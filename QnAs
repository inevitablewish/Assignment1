Answer the following questions in a Readme of a Git Repo and each answer should be in a separate commit, and host this repo on Github Pages
•	Agile vs DevOps
o	Agile fills the gap between customer and project delivery team where multiple small to medium features are being build concurrently. This methodology helps to get quick traction on errors / failures as it recursively being tested by the customer.
Whereas DevOps fill the gap between development team and operations where any value addition, modification, upgrades or updates to the application are carried out by following best practices. These practices define the DevOps processes.
=========================================
•	Define CI, Continuous Delivery & Continuous Deployment
o	CI is defined as a process to integrate any new or modified piece of code by following Unit Tests, Analysis and Coverage before it is stagged. 
o	Continuous Delivery is the next stage of Continuous integration where the feature is added to application in test / dev environment. Once tested successfully and approved for change, the push to production is carried out manually.
o	Once the CI/CD process is completed, Continuous Deployment is carried out to push the changes to Production. This is an automated process and does not involve any manual interaction from user to make changes from stagging to production
==========================================
•	What are the benefits of Cloud Computing
o	Application Scaling
o	Costs Reduction
o	No Physical Infrastructure. 
o	Focus on Application and not on the underlying Infrastructure.
